# Linear Gains are a single row list:
# proportional gain, integral gain, derivative gain
linear_pid: [11.0,16.0,0.250]

# Angular Gains are a list of values:
# max absolute value of linear velocity m/s, proportional gain, integral gain, 
# derivative gain.
# The first row is the lowest linear velocity, and each consecutive row is the
# next group of gains for the linear velocity.
